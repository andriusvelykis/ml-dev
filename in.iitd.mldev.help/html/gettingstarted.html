<h1>Getting started</h1>

<h2><a name="project">Creating a new project</a></h2>

<p>
Before you can write any SML program, you have to create the project that will contain it. A <dfn>project</dfn> is essentially a container for files and folders, and is used by Eclipse for organizing related resources together.
</p>

<ol>
<li>To create a new project, select the menu item <b>File &gt; New &gt; Project...</b> to open the New Project wizard.</li>
<li>Eclipse provides different kinds of projects, any of which can contain SML files. For now, select <b>Simple &gt; Project</b> and click <b>Next</b>.
<p><img src="images/project.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>In the next page, give a name for the project and click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The new project will appear in the Navigator view on the left. The Navigator allows you to manage all the projects, files and folders you create in Eclipse, which are collectively called the <dfn>workspace</dfn>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If you expand the project in the Navigator, you'll see a single file named <tt>.project</tt>. Don't do anything to this file; Eclipse uses it to store its information about the project.
</p>

<h2><a name="newfiles">Creating new files</a></h2>

<p>
Now you're ready to begin writing SML files in Eclipse. To get started, we'll create a new file.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click on the project and select <b>New &gt; File...</b> to open the New File wizard.</li>
<li>Enter a name for the file, and click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A new file will be created and will appear in the Package Explorer. The new, empty file will also be opened in an SML editor. Similarly, you can also create folders to organise files within a project.
</p>

<h2><a name="importing">Importing existing files into Eclipse</a></h2>

<p>
If you want to use Eclipse to work on existing files, you'll need to import them. This will copy the files into Eclipse's workspace so that they can be edited in Eclipse. (Note that any changes you make will not affect the original files.)
</p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click on the project into which the files should be copied, and select <b>Import...</b></li>
<li>In the Import wizard, select <b>File system</b> and click <b>Next</b>.
<p><img src="images/importing.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>Click <b>Browse...</b> and choose the directory containing the files.</li>
<li>The contents of the directory will be listed. Select the files that you want to import.
<p><img src="images/importing2.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>Click <b>Finish</b>. Expand the selected project to see the imported files.</li>
</ol>

<p>
To get the files back out into the file system, use the analogous Export wizard.
</p>
